# Staging Interaction

In the original stage production of Peter Pan, Tinker Bell was represented by a darting light created by a small handheld mirror off-stage, reflecting a little circle of light from a powerful lamp. Tinkerbell communicates her presence through this light to the other characters. See more info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker_Bell). 

There is no actor that plays Tinkerbell--her existence in the play comes from the interactions that the other characters have with her.

For lab this week, we draw on this and other inspirations from theatre to stage interactions with a device where the main mode of display/output for the interactive device you are designing is lighting. You will plot the interaction with a storyboard, and use your computer and a smartphone to experiment with what the interactions will look and feel like. 

_Make sure you read all the instructions and understand the whole of the laboratory activity before starting!_



## Prep

### To start the semester, you will need:
1. Read about Git [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F).
2. Set up your own Github "Lab Hub" repository to keep all you work in record by [following these instructions](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/blob/2021Fall/readings/Submitting%20Labs.md).
3. Set up the README.md for your Hub repository (for instance, so that it has your name and points to your own Lab 1) and [learn how to](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) organize and post links to your submissions on your README.md so we can find them easily.


### For this lab, you will need:
1. Paper
2. Markers/ Pens
3. Scissors
4. Smart Phone -- The main required feature is that the phone needs to have a browser and display a webpage.
5. Computer -- We will use your computer to host a webpage which also features controls.
6. Found objects and materials -- You will have to costume your phone so that it looks like some other devices. These materials can include doll clothes, a paper lantern, a bottle, human clothes, a pillow case, etc. Be creative!

### Deliverables for this lab are: 
1. 7 Storyboards
1. 3 Sketches/photos of costumed devices
1. Any reflections you have on the process
1. Video sketch of 3 prototyped interactions
1. Submit the items above in the lab1 folder of your class [Github page], either as links or uploaded files. Each group member should post their own copy of the work to their own Lab Hub, even if some of the work is the same from each person in the group.

### The Report
This README.md page in your own repository should be edited to include the work you have done (the deliverables mentioned above). Following the format below, you can delete everything but the headers and the sections between the **stars**. Write the answers to the questions under the starred sentences. Include any material that explains what you did in this lab hub folder, and link it in your README.md for the lab.


## Part A. Plan 


\*\***Describe your setting, players, activity and goals here.**\*\*

1.	The main character of my story is a Leprechaun. The settings are the different colored lands he ventures to. His goal in each land is to become that color. He has a special power which is chameleon powers.




\*\***Include pictures of your storyboards here**\*\*

Storyboard can be found in the .pptx file within Lab 1 Part 1 folder

\*\***Summarize feedback you got here.**\*\*

No specific feedback was received

## Part B. Act out the Interaction


\*\***Are there things that seemed better on paper than acted out?**\*\*

1.	Yes, moving the phone around and having it interact with the environment especially with larger objects was harder than anticipated.

\*\***Are there new ideas that occur to you or your collaborators that come up from the acting?**\*\*

2.	A new idea was to take breaks between settings to change the environment. Also logging into the zoom call with another device.

## Part C. Prototype the device


\*\***Give us feedback on Tinkerbelle.**\*\*

1.	Tinkerbelle is fairly easy to use and setup. It would be cool to include or have the option to add more features.

## Part D. Wizard the device

\*\***Include your first attempts at recording the set-up video here.**\*\*

This can be found in the .MOV file within Lab 1 folder.

\*\***Show the follow-up work here.**\*\*


## Part E. Costume the device


\*\***Include sketches of what your devices might look like here.**\*\*

The .jpeg file has sketches of costume ideas.

\*\***What concerns or opportunitities are influencing the way you've designed the device to look?**\*\*

The main influence is the hat which is inspired by the lucky charms Leperchaun.

## Part F. Record

\*\***Take a video of your prototyped interaction.**\*\*

This can be found in the .MOV file within Lab 1 Part 1 folder.



# Staging Interaction, Part 2 

This describes the second week's work for this lab activity.


## Prep (to be done before Lab on Wednesday)

You will be assigned three partners from another group. Go to their github pages, view their videos, and provide them with reactions, suggestions & feedback: explain to them what you saw happening in their video. Guess the scene and the goals of the character. Ask them about anything that wasn’t clear. 

Someone noted my Leperchaun idea as interesting!

## Make it your own

Do last week’s assignment again, but this time: 
1) It doesn’t have to (just) use light, 
2) You can use any modality (e.g., vibration, sound) to prototype the behaviors! Again, be creative! Feel free to fork and modify the tinkerbell code! 
3) We will be grading with an emphasis on creativity. 

\*\***Document everything here. (Particularly, we would like to see the storyboard and video, although photos of the prototype are also great.)**\*\*

Updated storyboard can be found in folder Part 2, FinalStoryboard

Final video can be found in folder Part 2, FinalVideo
